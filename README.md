```

## Installation & Run

### Backend

1. Install Python dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file and set your DeepSeek API key:

   ```
   DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
   ```

   - Note: The API key typically starts with `sk-`
   - You can obtain it at https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys

3. Start the backend:

   Using OpenAI SDK (recommended):

   ```
   cd backend
   python run_sdk.py
   ```

### Frontend

1. Install Node.js dependencies:

   ```
  cd frontend
   npm install
   npm install react-markdown react-syntax-highlighter --save
   npm install remark-gfm
   npm install react-datepicker
   npm install recharts
   ```

2. Start the frontend development server:

   ```
   npm start
   npm run build
   npm install -g serve
   serve -s build
   ```

## DeepSeek API Usage

This project supports two ways to call the DeepSeek API:

1. **Using `requests` (direct HTTP)**: Manually sending HTTP requests to the API endpoints
2. **Using OpenAI SDK**: Leverages OpenAI-compatible endpoints, which is the recommended approach by DeepSeek

Since DeepSeek provides OpenAI-compatible APIs, you can use the OpenAI SDK directly with minimal configuration.

### Supported Models

1. **DeepSeek-V3** (`deepseek-chat`): General-purpose model for everyday conversations and basic inquiries
2. **DeepSeek-R1** (`deepseek-reasoner`): Reasoning-optimized model for complex logic and analytical responses

Users can choose the desired model from a dropdown menu in the chat interface. Each model may respond differently in style and content.

### Markdown Support

The chat interface supports rendering Markdown-formatted responses, including:

- Headings (H1-H6)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Links and images
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables
- Blockquotes
- Bold, italic, and other text styles

This allows the AI assistant to present rich, structured content. Try prompting the assistant with something like:

```
Please provide a time management plan for today in Markdown, including a table and some code examples.
```

### Troubleshooting

1. **API Errors**:
   - Ensure your API key is valid (starts with `sk-`)
   - Verify the selected model name (`deepseek-chat` or `deepseek-reasoner`)
   - Check that request parameters are correctly formatted
2. **Timeouts**:
   - Might be due to network issues or slow API response — try increasing the timeout value
3. **Markdown Rendering Issues**:
   - Ensure `react-markdown` and `react-syntax-highlighter` are installed
   - Check that the AI's response conforms to proper Markdown syntax

## How to Use

1. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to open the app
2. Use the **"Task Management"** tab to add and manage tasks
3. Use the **"Chat Assistant"** tab to interact with the AI assistant for time management suggestions
   - Select your preferred model from the dropdown
   - Try prompting the AI to use Markdown (e.g., tables, code blocks) for better output formatting

## Update – April 25

1. **Added Conversation History**:
    The assistant now retains up to 5 rounds of context for better continuity, eliminating the issue of single-turn conversations.
2. **Improved Table Display**:
    Integrated the `remark-gfm` plugin to correctly render Markdown tables. No more garbled outputs when displaying time schedules.
3. **Fixed Chat Tab State Loss**:
    Resolved an issue where switching from Chat Assistant to Task Management would clear previous conversation history.
4. **Chat Output Stream Control**:
    You can now stop and interrupt the assistant’s response mid-generation if you realize your input was incorrect.
5. **Enhanced Date-Time Selection in Tasks**:
    Tasks now support selecting specific time (e.g., 10:00 AM or 3:00 PM), not just the date.
6. **Fixed Timezone Offset Bug**:
    Task date displays now correctly align with local time without unwanted timezone shifts.
